# Development

## Key Features

This fork extends the original [lance-mcp](https://github.com/adiom-data/lance-mcp) with:

- 🔄 **Recursive self-improvement** - Used its own tools to discover and apply design patterns
- 📚 **Formal concept model** - Rigorous definition ensuring semantic matching and disambiguation
- 🧠 **Enhanced concept extraction** - 80-150+ concepts per document (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- 🌐 **WordNet semantic enrichment** - Synonym expansion and hierarchical navigation
- 🔍 **Multi-signal hybrid ranking** - Vector + BM25 + title + concept + WordNet (4-signal scoring)
- 📖 **Large document support** - Multi-pass extraction for >100k token documents
- ⚡ **Parallel concept extraction** - Process up to 25 documents concurrently with shared rate limiting
- 🔁 **Resumable seeding** - Checkpoint-based recovery from interrupted runs
- 🛡️ **System resilience** - Circuit breaker, bulkhead, and timeout patterns for external services
- 📊 **Normalized schema (v7)** - Derived text fields eliminate ID cache lookups at runtime
- 🔗 **Concept relationships** - Adjacent (co-occurrence) and related (lexical) concept linking
- 🏥 **Health checks** - Database integrity verification with detailed reporting
- 🏗️ **Clean Architecture** - Domain-Driven Design patterns throughout (see [REFERENCES.md](../REFERENCES.md))

### Four-Table Normalized Schema

- **Catalog**: Document metadata with derived `concept_names`, `category_names`
- **Chunks**: Text segments with `catalog_title`, `concept_names`
- **Concepts**: Deduplicated index with lexical/adjacent relationships
- **Categories**: Hierarchical taxonomy with statistics

See [database-schema.md](database-schema.md) for complete schema documentation.

## Design Principles

This project follows Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design patterns.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

All major technical decisions are documented in **[Architecture Decision Records](architecture/README.md)**.

### Key Documentation

- **[API Reference](api-reference.md)** - Complete MCP tool documentation with JSON I/O schemas
- **[Activity/Skill Architecture](architecture/skills-interface.md)** - Activity-based tool selection
- **[Database Schema](database-schema.md)** - Four-table normalized schema with derived fields
- **[Test Suite](../src/__tests__/README.md)** - Comprehensive test documentation

## Building

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:unit           # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration    # Integration tests only
```

## Seeding Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--filesdir` | Directory containing PDF/EPUB files (required) |
| `--dbpath` | Database path (default: `~/.concept_rag`) |
| `--overwrite` | Drop and recreate all database tables |
| `--parallel N` | Process N documents concurrently (default: 10, max: 25) |
| `--resume` | Skip documents already in checkpoint (for interrupted runs) |
| `--clean-checkpoint` | Clear checkpoint file and start fresh |
| `--rebuild-concepts` | Rebuild concept index even if no new documents |
| `--auto-reseed` | Re-process documents with incomplete metadata |
| `--max-docs N` | Process at most N new documents (for batching) |
| `--with-wordnet` | Enable WordNet enrichment (disabled by default) |

**Seed specific documents:**

```bash
# By hash prefix (shown in seeding output)
npx tsx scripts/seed_specific.ts --hash 3cde 7f2b

# By filename pattern
npx tsx scripts/seed_specific.ts --pattern "Transaction Processing"
```

## Maintenance Scripts

```bash
# Health check - verify database integrity
npx tsx scripts/health-check.ts

# Rebuild derived name fields (after schema changes)
npx tsx scripts/rebuild_derived_names.ts --dbpath ~/.concept_rag

# Link related concepts (lexical similarity)
npx tsx scripts/link_related_concepts.ts --dbpath ~/.concept_rag

# Analyze backup differences
npx tsx scripts/analyze-backups.ts backup1/ backup2/
```

See [../scripts/README.md](../scripts/README.md) for all maintenance utilities.

# Intent: Identify Patterns

## Problem Domain

**User Goal:** Find design patterns applicable to a specific problem or domain.

## Recognition

- "What patterns apply to X?"
- "Design patterns for X"
- "How do others solve X?"
- "Patterns for error handling / caching / etc."
- "What's the recommended pattern for X?"

## Maps To

**Primary Skill:** [pattern-research](../skills/pattern-research.md)

**Supporting Skills:**
- [deep-research](../skills/deep-research.md) — Find detailed pattern implementations
- [document-analysis](../skills/document-analysis.md) — Extract concepts from pattern-rich sources

## Expected Outcome

- Applicable design patterns with sources
- Pattern descriptions and trade-offs
- How to apply patterns to the problem
- Detailed implementations from key sources
- Confidence level for each pattern

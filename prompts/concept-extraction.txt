FORMAL DEFINITION:
A concept is an abstract or concrete idea that can be identified, defined, and 
reused across texts. Concepts enable semantic search by capturing the MEANING 
of content at multiple levels of abstraction.

Extract ALL significant concepts from this document as JSON.

{CONTENT}

Return JSON with these 3 fields:
1. primary_concepts: Array of 80-150 strings (concepts at ALL levels: themes, methods, terms)
2. categories: Array of 3-7 strings (academic/professional domain names)
3. related_concepts: Array of 20-40 strings (related concepts from adjacent domains)

EXTRACTION STRATEGY:
Think hierarchically - extract concepts at THREE levels:

🔺 LEVEL 1 - Thematic (10-20): Core themes and principles
   Examples: "innovation", "sustainability", "emergence", "complexity", "creativity"
   Test: "Could this be a book title or course name?"

🔹 LEVEL 2 - Methodological (30-50): Theories, frameworks, processes  
   Examples: "TRIZ", "design thinking", "agent-based modeling", "systems theory"
   Test: "Could someone specialize in this or write a paper about it?"

🔸 LEVEL 3 - Technical (40-80): Domain-specific terminology and techniques
   Examples: "ideality index", "contradiction matrix", "exaptive bootstrapping"
   Test: "Would this appear in a domain glossary or index?"

IMPORTANT RULES:

✅ DO EXTRACT:
- All three levels above
- Both single-word and multi-word concepts
- Concepts that unify multiple discussions
- Book/chapter titles if they're conceptual (e.g., "innovation algorithm")

❌ DO NOT EXTRACT:
- Specific instances (e.g., "the 2015 study", "Company X's approach")  
- Temporal phrases (e.g., "during the crisis", "in recent years")
- Pure actions without conceptual content (e.g., "balancing three priorities")
  → But DO extract the concepts involved (e.g., "balance", "priority management")
- Names of people, organizations, locations
- Dates, page numbers, figure references

CATEGORIES:
Use standard academic/professional domain names:
- Good: "innovation methodology", "systems engineering", "cognitive psychology"
- Bad: "innovation", "systems", "psychology" (too broad)
- Bad: "TRIZ su-field analysis" (too specific)

Use lowercase. Output complete JSON with ALL fields fully populated.

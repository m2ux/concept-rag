FORMAL DEFINITION:
A concept is an abstract or concrete idea that can be identified, defined, and 
reused across texts. Concepts enable semantic search by capturing the MEANING 
of content at multiple levels of abstraction.

Extract ALL significant concepts from this document as JSON, with a one-sentence 
summary for each concept based on how it appears in this specific document.

{CONTENT}

Return JSON with these 2 fields:
1. primary_concepts: Array of 80-150 objects, each with:
   - "name": concept name (string)
   - "summary": one-sentence definition based on this document's context (string)
2. categories: Array of 3-7 strings (academic/professional domain names)

EXTRACTION STRATEGY:
Think hierarchically - extract concepts at THREE levels:

🔺 LEVEL 1 - Thematic (10-20): Core themes and principles
   Examples: "innovation", "sustainability", "emergence", "complexity", "creativity"
   Test: "Could this be a book title or course name?"

🔹 LEVEL 2 - Methodological (30-50): Theories, frameworks, processes  
   Examples: "TRIZ", "design thinking", "agent-based modeling", "systems theory"
   Test: "Could someone specialize in this or write a paper about it?"

🔸 LEVEL 3 - Technical (40-80): Domain-specific terminology and techniques
   Examples: "ideality index", "contradiction matrix", "exaptive bootstrapping"
   Test: "Would this appear in a domain glossary or index?"

SUMMARY REQUIREMENTS:
For each concept, write a one-sentence summary that:
- Captures how this concept is used or defined IN THIS DOCUMENT
- Is clear and concise (15-30 words)
- Avoids starting with "A concept that..." or similar phrasing
- Provides actionable understanding of what the concept means

Examples:
- Good: "The process of creating value by combining existing resources in novel ways."
- Bad: "A concept related to innovation." (too vague)
- Bad: "Exaptive bootstrapping refers to..." (unnecessary prefix)

IMPORTANT RULES:

✅ DO EXTRACT:
- All three levels above
- Both single-word and multi-word concepts
- Concepts that unify multiple discussions
- Book/chapter titles if they're conceptual (e.g., "innovation algorithm")

⚠️ SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Avoid generic single words that could be ambiguous across domains
- Add domain context when a term is overloaded:
  → "strategy" → "strategy pattern" (software) or "military strategy" (warfare)
  → "factory" → "factory pattern" (software) or "factory automation" (manufacturing)
  → "observer" → "observer pattern" (software) or "participant observation" (research)
- Prefer "X pattern", "X principle", "X framework" over bare terms when applicable
- If a concept is domain-specific, include enough context for disambiguation
  → Good: "separation of concerns", "dependency injection", "feedback loops"
  → Bad: "separation", "dependency", "feedback" (too generic)

❌ DO NOT EXTRACT:
- Generic single words without domain context (e.g., "strategy", "pattern", "system")
- Specific instances (e.g., "the 2015 study", "Company X's approach")  
- Temporal phrases (e.g., "during the crisis", "in recent years")
- Pure actions without conceptual content (e.g., "balancing three priorities")
  → But DO extract the concepts involved (e.g., "balance", "priority management")
- Names of people, organizations, locations
- Dates, page numbers, figure references

CATEGORIES:
Use standard academic/professional domain names:
- Good: "innovation methodology", "systems engineering", "cognitive psychology"
- Bad: "innovation", "systems", "psychology" (too broad)
- Bad: "TRIZ su-field analysis" (too specific)

Use lowercase for concept names. Output complete JSON with ALL fields fully populated.

Example output format:
{
  "primary_concepts": [
    {"name": "dependency injection", "summary": "A technique for achieving loose coupling by passing dependencies to objects rather than having them create their own."},
    {"name": "separation of concerns", "summary": "Organizing code into distinct sections where each addresses a specific aspect of functionality."}
  ],
  "categories": ["software architecture", "design patterns", "object-oriented programming"]
}

Analyze this image from a technical document.

Classify it as ONE of:
- diagram: flowcharts, UML, architecture diagrams, state machines, sequence diagrams, dependency graphs
- flowchart: process flows, decision trees, workflow diagrams
- chart: bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, histograms
- table: structured tabular data, matrices
- figure: technical illustrations with labels, annotated diagrams
- skip: photographs, screenshots, decorative images, logos, icons, cover images, AND any of the following:

MUST classify as "skip":
- Scanned pages or page fragments containing mostly text
- Images that are primarily text with only small graphical elements
- Horizontal or vertical strips/slices of pages
- Images with extreme aspect ratios (very wide and short, or very tall and narrow)
- Low quality or blurry scans
- Pages from OCR-scanned documents

IMPORTANT: Only classify as diagram/flowchart/chart/table/figure if:
1. The image has clear semantic technical meaning
2. The PRIMARY content is the diagram/chart, not surrounding text
3. The image appears to be an intentional figure, not a page scan artifact

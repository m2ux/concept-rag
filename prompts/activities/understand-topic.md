# Activity: Understand a Topic

## Problem Domain

**User Goal:** The user has a knowledge gap about a specific topic and wants to learn what their library says about it.

## Recognition

Match this activity when the user says:
- "What does my library say about X?"
- "Research topic X"
- "I want to understand X"
- "Deep dive into X"
- "Learn about X from my documents"
- "What do my sources say about X?"

## Maps To

**Primary Skill:** [deep-research](../skills/deep-research.md)

**Supporting Skills:**
- [concept-exploration](../skills/concept-exploration.md) — Find related concepts and where they appear
- [document-analysis](../skills/document-analysis.md) — Extract key concepts from important sources

## Expected Outcome

A synthesized answer that:
- Addresses the user's question directly
- Draws from multiple relevant documents
- Includes citations to sources
- Provides key points and insights
- Surfaces related concepts for further exploration

## Example Flow

```
User: "What does my library say about microservices?"

1. Use deep-research skill to find and extract content
2. If key documents emerge, use document-analysis to extract concepts
3. Use concept-exploration to find related concepts (e.g., "distributed systems")
4. Synthesize comprehensive answer with citations
```

## Context to Preserve

- The topic being researched
- Documents found relevant
- Key findings from each source

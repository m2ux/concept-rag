# API Documentation Consolidation

Quick navigation for work package planning documents.

## Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) | Executive summary and progress tracking |
| [01-overlap-analysis.md](01-overlap-analysis.md) | Content overlap between the two files |
| [02-work-package-plan.md](02-work-package-plan.md) | Detailed implementation tasks |

## Context

**Problem:** Two documentation files with significant overlap:
- `docs/tool-selection-guide.md` (813 lines) - Selection guidance, decision trees, examples
- `docs/api-reference.md` (556 lines) - API parameters, brief selection guidance

**Solution:** Consolidate into a single comprehensive `api-reference.md` with:
- Full JSON input schemas
- Full JSON response schemas
- All selection guidance and patterns
- Technical details and performance characteristics

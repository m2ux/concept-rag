# Concept Extraction Enhancement

**Date Range:** November 13, 2025  
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

Major overhaul of the concept extraction system including prompt refactoring, improved extraction logic, and comprehensive testing. This was one of the most significant improvements to the core functionality.

## Key Deliverables

2. **prompt-refactoring-implementation.md** - Implementation of prompt refactoring with discrete configuration
3. **plain-text-prompts-final.md** - Final plain-text prompt templates
4. **concept-extraction-fixes-summary.md** - Summary of all concept extraction fixes
5. **concept-extraction-json-error-fix.md** - Fix for JSON parsing errors in concept extraction
6. **FORMAL_CONCEPT_DEFINITION.md** - Formal definition of what constitutes a concept
7. **CONCEPT_EXTRACTION.md** - Guide for concept extraction features
8. **CONCEPT_EXTRACTION_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of concept extraction results
9. **EXTRACT_CONCEPTS_FIX.md** - Fixes to extraction script
10. **EXTRACT_CONCEPTS_UPDATE.md** - Updates to extraction functionality
11. **LATEST_EXTRACTION_SUMMARY.md** - Latest extraction results and statistics
12. **GROK4_FULL_EXTRACTION_UPDATE.md** - Updates related to Grok-4 integration

## Summary

Comprehensive refactoring of the concept extraction system moving from inline prompts to discrete configuration files. Implemented Option C (Hybrid Approach) with improved extraction logic that produces 100+ high-quality concepts per document. Added MCP tool and CLI script for concept extraction.

## Outcome

Significantly improved concept extraction quality and maintainability. Extraction now produces detailed, granular concepts (e.g., 397 concepts from Art of War) enabling superior conceptual search capabilities.
